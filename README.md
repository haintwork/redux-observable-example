# About Project

This is only dumb project for fun, but it would be good if someone can benefit from it.
As We know handling asynchrony in redux can be done in several ways by adding middleware
such as `redux-thunk` and `redux-saga` but I feel they don't cover advanced functionalities
such cancellation, map to another async, and the declarativeness.
(Please don't judge this only personal opinion).
